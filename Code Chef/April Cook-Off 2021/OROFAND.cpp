/*
You are given an array A with N integers. An array's score is defined as the bitwise AND of all its elements. You need to find the bitwise OR of the scores of all 
possible non-empty subarrays of A. Furthermore, there are Q queries. Each query consists of two integers X and V. You need to change the value of the element at index 
X to V. After each query, you again need to find the bitwise OR of the scores of all possible non-empty subarrays.
Input:
The first line of the input contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q - the size of the array and the number of queries, respectively.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,â€¦,AN.
Each of the next Q lines contains two space-separated integers X and V - the position and the new value of the query, respectively.
Output:
For each test case print Q+1 lines. In the first line print the answer for the original array and in the next Q lines print the answer after every query.
Sample Input:
2
3 2
1 2 3
1 4
3 0
4 1
1 2 3 4
4 0
Sample Output:
3
7
