/*
There are n chocolates, and you are given an array of n numbers where the i-th number Ai is the flavour type of the i-th chocolate. Sebrina wants to eat as many different 
types of chocolates as possible, but she also has to save at least x number of chocolates for her little brother.
Find the maximum possible number of distinct flavour types Sebrina can have.
Input:
The first line contains an integer T --- the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case consists of two integers n, x - The number of chocolates Sabrina has and the number of chocolates she has to save for her brother, respectively.
The second line contains n integers A1,â€¦,An, where the i-th chocolate has type Ai.
Output:
For each test case, output a single integer denoting the maximum possible number of distinct chocolate flavours Sabrina can eat
Sample Input:
3
2 1
1 2
4 2
1 1 1 1
5 3
50 50 50 100 100
Sample Output:
